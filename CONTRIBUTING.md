# Contributing

Gitrob should be considered Beta and there is probably a good amount of bugs. Bug reports and suggestions for improvements are welcome!

Another way to help out is to contribute new patterns for sensitive files. If you know of any sensitive files that are not already identified, please submit them in a pull request. I am especially interested in sensitive web framework files and configuration files. Have a look at the [patterns.json](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob/blob/master/patterns.json) file to see what is already looked for.

## How to make a pull request:

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
